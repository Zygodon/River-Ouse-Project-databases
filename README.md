# River-Ouse-Project-databases
Public access facilities for the River Ouse Project databases (gills; meadows).

The River Ouse Project was started by Dr Margaret Pilkington and colleagues in the Centre for Continuing Education, University of Sussex. Margaret is now retired with emeritus status and continues to run the project with a team of volunteers, in association with the University of Sussex.

The team does botanical surveys of streamside grassland and steep wooded valleys (gills) in the upper reaches of the Sussex Ouse, a short flashy river arising on the southern slopes of the Ashdown Forest, part of the High Weald AONB. Survey sites are chosen on the basis of species richness, potential for restoration and contribution to flood control, and surveyed using the sampling methods outlined in Rodwell, J S (1992. British Plant Communities, Volume 3, Grasslands and Montane Communities). Survey data are transferred from the paper record taken in the field to Excel spreadsheets, and from there after validation and cleaning into two MySQL (MariaDB) databases, meadows and gills.

The objective of this project is to make the databases publicly available, and to develop resources to make commonly needed derived quantities such as species frequencies readily accessible.
