## The River Ouse Project.

The [River Ouse Project](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/riverouse/) was started by Dr Margaret Pilkington and colleagues in the Centre for Continuing Education, University of Sussex. Margaret is now retired with emeritus status and continues to run the project with a team of volunteers, in association with the University of Sussex.

The team does botanical surveys of streamside grassland and steep wooded valleys (gills) in the upper reaches of the Sussex Ouse, a short flashy river arising on the southern slopes of the High Weald AONB (Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty). Survey sites are chosen on the basis of species richness, potential for restoration and contribution to flood control, and surveyed using the sampling methods outlined in Rodwell, J S (1992. British Plant Communities, Volume 3, Grasslands and Montane Communities). Survey data are transferred from the paper record taken in the field to Excel spreadsheets, and from there after validation and cleaning into two MySQL (MariaDB) databases, meadows and gills.

My objective here is to make the databases publicly available, and to develop resources to make commonly needed derived quantities such as species frequencies readily accessible.

## The meadows database.

## Database access.

### Access from R.
The database can be accessed from R or other programming language. You can use a simple query:

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library("RMySQL")
mydb <- dbConnect(MySQL(), 
                   user  = "guest",
                   password    = "guest",
                   dbname="meadows",
                   port = 3306,
                   host   = "sxouse.ddns.net")
rs1 = dbSendQuery(mydb, "select assembly_name, community from surveys where community is not null;")
data <- fetch(rs1, n=10)
dbDisconnect(mydb)
print(data)
```

Or more complicated joins:

```{r}
library("RMySQL")
q <- "select assembly_name, community, count(distinct(species.species_id))
from surveys
join quadrats on quadrats.survey_id = surveys_id
join records on records.quadrat_id = quadrats_id
join species on species.species_id = records.species_id
where community in ('MG5a', 'MG5c', 'MG6a', 'MG6b')
# and species.species_name = 'Lolium_perenne'
group by surveys_id;" 

mydb <- dbConnect(MySQL(), 
                   user  = "guest",
                   password    = "guest",
                   dbname="meadows",
                   port = 3306,
                   host   = "sxouse.ddns.net")
rs1 = dbSendQuery(mydb, q)
data <- fetch(rs1, n=10)
dbDisconnect(mydb)
print(data)
```
### Access from spreadsheet.
Single tables can be imported into Excel using the MySQL for Excel add-in, use the information shown in the code snippets to create a connection.

### Access from Shiny App: Meadows DB recovery
The Meadows DB recovery app reconstructs an approximation to the original spreadsheets from the meadows surveys, and also gives the name of the Excel file from which the data were entered into the DB. This should be useful to the volunteer team when trying to locate the original files.
[Click here to run it](https://sussexouse.shinyapps.io/the_meadows_DB_recovery_app_2_1/)

### Access from Shiny App: Species Explorer
The on-line app summarises species frequencies and counts by community or assembly.  You can download the summaries, and the raw extract from which they were calculated, as .csv files suitable for import into a spreadsheet. You can also download the R code used to make the summaries.

## Tables.

### Records.
The records table records all the entries that the surveyors made on the recording sheets. Essentially, it records that a particular species(identified by species_id) was present in a particular quadrat (quadrat_id) with a particular domin value (abundance). Every record has a unique record_id.

### Species.
The species table is a list of all the plant species found during the course of the project. The species names are those used in the NVC tables. We retain them in this long-running project for the sake of continuity and compatibility with reports completed earlier. The synonym field contains the more recent names (Stace), and formal common names are included in the english-names field. Species names are given in full (genus and species) without abbreviation, and with an underscore between the generic and the specific name, for ease of digital import. There is one anomalous species name, "Agrostis_capillaris_stolonifera". A. capillaris and A. stolonifera are readily distinguished when flowers are available, but can be indistinguishable on vegetative characteristics. Surveys often take place out of the flowering season so for the time being we treat all the records as unreliable (and tend to exclude A. capillaris_stolonifera from our analyses). This policy may be reviewed in future.

You can find which species is recorded in a particular record (e.g. 229) with something like: 

SELECT species_name FROM species JOIN records ON records.species_id = species.species_id WHERE records_id = 229;

If you wanted to.

### Quadrats.
The sampling unit for the project is a quadrat. Quadrats belong to surveys (see next paragraph for a definition), identified by an survey_id which points to the survey to which the quadrat belongs. Every quadrat has a unique quadrat_id that can be used to find the records belonging to it, that is, the plants found in that quadrat. 

You could find which plant species were found in a particular quadrat (e.g. 1751) with something like:

SELECT DISTINCT (species_name) FROM species 
  JOIN records ON records.species_id = species.species_id
  JOIN quadrats ON records.quadrat_id = quadrats.quadrats_id
WHERE quadrats_id = 1751;

### Surveys.
Assemblies are the vegetative units that we sample; one assembly is sampled on each survey. Sites and meadows record the location of our samples, but often it is found that one meadow may have several recognisable vegetative units in it. The constraint link between the sites and meadows tables in Figure 1 show this one-to-many relationship. Quadrats need to know which survey they belong to, so the quadrats table entries each have a survey_id which can be used to join the surveys and quadrats tables on surveys_id = survey_id. Note the naming convention here, which we adhere to throughout: Parent items (surveys) have a (plural) surveys_id; child items (quadrats) have a (singular) survey_id because each was part of a vegetative assembly that was sampled on a particular survey date.

The surveys table also records the quadrat count for the survey, and the size of quadrat used to sample it. We use either 2mx2m or 4mx4m quadrats.

For each survey, the team assign an NVC class by matching the NVC standards using MATCH software together with an understanding of general grassland ecology. The assessed NVC class is listed in the community column, and the top-level NVC community is in major_nvc_community.

### mg_rodwell.
This table contains mesotrophic grassland species frequencies listed in British Plant Communities vol 3, Grasslands and Montane Communities.

### mg_stds_v.
For some analyses (specifically, the 2019 BES poster) we used a set of 22 species selected because each occurred with a frequency of V (0.8 - 1.0, mid-range 0.8) in at least one of the mesotrophic grassland standards of interest. The mg_stds_v table lists them.
